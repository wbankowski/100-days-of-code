# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Wanted to start a blog using Vue, so I configured site with VuePress and deployed it on Netlify. Modified config.js script to automaticaly generate Sidebar from YAML Front Matter metadata of each .md file in /docs/blog/ directory. I described the process [here](http://akcel.io/blog/Day1.html) 

**Thoughts:** A lot of array and object modification which learnt me a lot. I had to use additional modules like glob and front-matter. Next step is to create Vue component which displays as a grid of cards every single post located in /blog/ directory.
